# Wine Quality Predictions

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook project focused on predicting the quality of wine. Wine quality is a subjective measure, and this project aims to use machine learning techniques to predict it based on various chemical attributes.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/wine-quality-predictions.git
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Navigate to the `wine_quality_predictions.ipynb` notebook and open it.

## Project Overview

In this Jupyter Notebook project, we perform the following steps:

1. Data Loading: We start by loading the dataset containing information about various chemical properties of wines and their associated quality ratings.

2. Data Exploration: We explore the dataset to gain insights into its structure, distribution, and relationships between variables.

3. Data Preprocessing: Data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, scaling, and encoding categorical variables are performed to prepare the data for modeling.

4. Data Splitting: We split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of our predictive models.

5. Model Building: Several machine learning algorithms are employed to build predictive models. We experiment with various techniques to find the best-performing model.

6. Model Evaluation: We evaluate the models using appropriate metrics and visualize the results to make informed decisions about model selection.

7. Conclusion: We summarize the findings and discuss the implications of the wine quality predictions.
